# SSN-Simple-Social-Network

Simple Social Network mock iOS Application to refresh my skills as an iOS developer :)

This project uses MVP architecture and has no database or whatsoever.
UIKit is used instead of relatively new SwiftUI declarative paradigm.
Both posts and users are handled locally.

to run just: 

```
pod install
```

in file directory.

Project includes two external dependencies

```
  pod 'iOSDropDown'
  pod 'KMPlaceholderTextView', '~> 1.4.0'
